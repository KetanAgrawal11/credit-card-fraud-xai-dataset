# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset ‚Äì Realistic & Explainable

Welcome to the official dataset repository for our research project titled:

> **"Explainable AI for Credit Card Fraud Detection Using a Novel Feature-Rich Dataset"**

This dataset was created to simulate **real-world transaction behavior**, focusing on helping researchers build **accurate and explainable AI models** for fraud detection.

## üßæ About the Dataset

Most public fraud datasets are outdated, anonymized, or unrealistically balanced. Ours is different.

This dataset was **synthetically generated with domain insights** to closely reflect real-world financial transactions. It includes:

- **1.4 million transactions**
- **38 engineered features**
- **Fraud rate of ~0.07%**, closely aligned with real-world financial fraud rates

It‚Äôs designed for **machine learning** and **XAI research**, with special attention to behavioral analysis, category-wise risk, temporal patterns, and geographic anomalies.
